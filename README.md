Easy to use public src CNC & C2 made in python, if you need any help message eon_lol on telegram



Use ubuntu 22.04 for setup.sh to work.

for auto setup do:

chmod 777 setup.sh
./setup.sh

it should auto install all packages.

After that, simply just do either

python3 main.py
or
python3 main.py debug

and your cnc will run :)
